# Hackathon-Wishlist

# What are we building ?? 

## Todays hackathon will be a dive into working with git in a group fashion, using another api, data-persistance with firebase, and how to build your roadmap from scratch.

We will be working through a full wishlist application together that will involve all the concepts we have touched on so far in class. You do not have to work at the pass of the rest the group but it is highly encouraged so you can help the friend next to you if they get a little lost and we can all stay on the same page! Please please as soon as you are scratching your head speak up ! We can't help if we don't know your lost!! 

# To get started
